The dual viscous-elastic behaviour of the Earth can be demonstrated using the "silly putty", which jumps up like a rubber ball (acts like solid) when we drop it on the floor for a very short timescale, but demonstrates more fluid-like behaviors in a longer time period (few days/weeks).

## Rock rheology

Followingly is a small summary of different types of rheology. The major difference between them is the composition of the bulk deviatoric strain rate $\dot{\epsilon}_{ij}'$. For example, it is decomposed into 2 respective components for visco-plastic rheology as $\dot{\epsilon}_{ij}' = \dot{\epsilon}_{ij\text{(viscous)}}' + \dot{\epsilon}_{ij\text{(plastic)}}'$


- **visco-plastic:** a strain rate based formation is more suitable. Simplification by assuming that elastic effects are negligible and can be ignored on the long time scales.


- **visco-elastic:** a stress-based formulation is more suitable. Viscous and elastic rheological relations are combined under certain physical assumptions. Maxwell visco-elastic rheology is the most commenly used type. Definitions of shear and bulk moduli are modified in the equations. More see section 12.4 in (Gerya 2019)


- **visco-elasto-plastic:** a stress-based formulation is more suitable. It characterises the non-linear instantaneous response at higher stress levels or temperature


- **poro-elastic:** Biot's model and its validity at low stress level and negligible viscous relaxation


- **poro-elasto-plastic:** 


- **thermo-hydro-chemico-mechanical (THCM):** thermal and chemical couplings to deformation (mechanics)


NOTE: in general, coupling among processes triggers non-linear interactions that may result in significant and spontaneous localization of flow, heat and deformation.
