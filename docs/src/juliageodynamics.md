# [GeoParams.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGeodynamics/GeoParams.jl.git) API


### Features

- [x] Functors to available creep laws
- [x] Elasticity struct
- [x] Interoperability with ParallelStencil.jl
- [x] `compute_viscosity()` agnostic to input parameters
- [x] composable custom creep law

The following API is created using the docstrings avaliable within the `ParallelStencil.jl` package, and is included for convinience here for look-up purpose. Please refer to the official repository and ask the creator of the packages if anything is unclear.
