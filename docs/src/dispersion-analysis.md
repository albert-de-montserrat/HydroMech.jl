# Dispersion Analysis

Using the tools from dispersion analysis, we can analyze the number of iterations required to reach convergence given equations prescribing a physical process.


## Numerical dispersion

> Numerical dispersion: a difficulty with computer simulations of continua (such as fluids) wherein the simulated medium exhibits a higher dispersivity than the true medium. [wikipedia](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Numerical_dispersion)
