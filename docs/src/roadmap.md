# Roadmap

First phase for Julia's course:
1. Add compressibility terms to two-phase flow equations
2. Reproduce fluid injection 2D benchmark in [Luca et al. 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040195122003109)

Next steps:
1. Add inertial term to Stokes equations
2. Benchmark (any refs for this?)
3. Move to 3D
