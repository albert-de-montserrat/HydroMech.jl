# Overview


## [ParallelStencil.jl](https://github.com/omlins/ParallelStencil.jl)

to make architecture agnostic kernels. This is the place to look if we want to further optimize stencil operations in the future.



## [ImplicitGlobalGrid.jl](https://github.com/eth-cscs/ImplicitGlobalGrid.jl) 

Almost trivial distributed parallelization of stencil-based GPU and CPU applications on a regular staggered grid


MPI/CUDA-aware MPI communication.
