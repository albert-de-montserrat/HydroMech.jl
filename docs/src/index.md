# HydroMech.jl
*The Hydro-mechanical solver package.*

>HydroMech.jl was developed during the attendance of the course 101-0250-00L at ETH ZÃ¼rich, which is designed to be a 
> module of the PTSolver/JustRelax.jl package. It utilizes the pseudo-transient method for efficiency of the PDEs 
> solving. It is designed to be able to run on both CPUs and GPUs.
