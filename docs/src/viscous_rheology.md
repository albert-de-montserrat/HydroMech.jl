## Viscous Rheology

Crystallized materials can deform during solid-state creep

=> sensitive to pressure, temperature.

eg. mantle viscosity measured from glacial terrasses $10^2 Pa \cdot s$


## Classification of the responses

### 1). Newtonian rhelogy

$$ \dot{\gamma}' = A \cdot \tau$$


Viscous strain rate is proportional to applied deviatoric stress

Newtonian because of the linear relationship

=> this behavior characteristic for diffusion creep 

- diffusion inside atoms, produce deformation of the crystal (Myr)

- caused by jumping between vacancies

- essential for the fact that the viscousity of the rock depends on the temperature

#### Example: Herring-Nabarro creep

- diffusion through crystal interior

#### Example: Cable' creep

- diffusion through the crystal boundaries

=> faster diffusion


#### Dependency of creep's speed and the grain size

For the grain size the relation holds (power law dependence)

$A \tilde \frac{1}{h^2}$


=> eg. slap is related to the grain size]]


### 2). Non-Newtonian Rheology

$$\dot{\gamma} = B \cdpt \tau^n$$, where normally $n > 1$, typically n = 3.

=> doubling the stresses obtain 8 times faster the strain rate

=> this relation is caused by dislocation creep

- defects of crystal lattice


=> NOTE: coefficient $B$ is not dependent on the grain size


#### Dislocation density

- depends on deviatoric stress




## Experimentally-calibrated flow law

- desired: steady state deformation
