"""  BasicTypes.jl
contains basic types that is commonly used in geophysical modeling
associated with PTArray which is a wrapper for the multi-xPU arrays of the ParallelStencil.jl package

1. Field Variables    (Scalar, Vector, Tensor)
2. Mesh topology      (staggered grid)
3. Equations          (for representing PDEs to be solved)

NOTE: other types can be customly added but once we use routines of ParallelStencil.jl package, we need
to also have them exported in MetaHydroMech.jl script under src
"""


#======= 1. Field Variables ========#
"""
In continuum mechanics, we use three major types of field variables (scalar, vector, tensor) to describe the physical properties of a continuum.
In order to provide an adequate level of abstraction, we create two new basic types that correspond to PTVector and PTSymmetricTensor. 
Both types are based on the PTArray type which we defined in the MetaHydroMech.jl. The so-called PTArrays are just a high-level abstraction for multi-xPU arrays, 
which do not necessarily need to be used for only the PT method. We follow the same naming convention to avoid naming duplicance with other packages with the "PT" prefix here.
